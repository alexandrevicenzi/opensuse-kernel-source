Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: fix receiver regression
Git-commit: 7c3d02285ad558691f27fde760bcd841baa27eab
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc3

While assumed not to make a difference, not using the factor-2 prescaler
makes the receiver more susceptible to errors.

Specifically, there have been reports of problems with devices that
cannot generate a 115200 rate with a smaller error than 2.1% (e.g.
117647 bps). But this can also be reproduced with a low-speed RS232
tranceiver at 115200 when the input rate matches the nominal rate.

So whenever possible, enable the factor-2 prescaler and halve the
divisor in order to use settings closer to that of the previous
algorithm.
