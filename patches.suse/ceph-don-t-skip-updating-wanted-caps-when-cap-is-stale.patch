Subject: ceph: don't skip updating wanted caps when cap is stale
Git-commit: 0aa971b6fd3f92afef6afe24ef78d9bb14471519
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1205905

1. try_get_cap_refs() fails to get caps and finds that mds_wanted
   does not include what it wants. It returns -ESTALE.
2. ceph_get_caps() calls ceph_renew_caps(). ceph_renew_caps() finds
   that inode has cap, so it calls ceph_check_caps().
3. ceph_check_caps() finds that issued caps (without checking if it's
   stale) already includes caps wanted by open file, so it skips
   updating wanted caps.

Above events can cause an infinite loop inside ceph_get_caps().
